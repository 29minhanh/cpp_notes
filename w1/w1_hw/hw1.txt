Program 1:  You need a program to maintain information about pay raises for employees.
Each employee's data include their name, their department, their current yearly income, and their raise percentage.
Assume that the following data is to be used:    

Name	Department	Current Yearly Income	Raise Percentage
James, Kobe	Accounting	$66111.54	6.6%
Walton, Lebron	Marketing	$89224.17	4.8%
Rondo, Luke	Sales	$75123.25	7.4%
Bryant, Kyle	Sales	$69644.44	5.5%
Kuzma, Rajon	Marketing	$96222.77	3.9%

Write a C++ program which uses appropriate functions and parameter passing that will perform the following tasks:

Task 1: Allow the user to enter in the data for each employee.  (The user will not enter the $ or % symbols.) 
Task 2: For each employee, calculate the Raise Amount and the New Pay Amount.

	Raise Amount = Current Yearly Income * Raise Percentage / 100  
	New Pay Amount = Current Yearly Income + Raise Amount

Task 3: For each employee, print out of their Name, Department, Current Yearly Income, Raise Percentage, Raise Amount, and New Pay Amount.
Task 4: Calculate and print the total of the current yearly incomes, the total of the raise amounts, and the total of the new pay amounts for the five employees.
Task 5: Print the average of the Raise Amounts along with the largest and smallest Raise Amounts.
